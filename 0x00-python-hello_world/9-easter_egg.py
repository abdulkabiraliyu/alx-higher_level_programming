 Beautiful is {bt} ugly.\n
 Explicit is {bt} implicit.\n
 Simple is {bt} complex.\n
 Complex is {bt} complicated.\n
 Flat is {bt} nested.\n
 Sparse is {bt} dense.\n
 {r} counts.\n
 Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\n
 Although {pr} beats purity.\n
 Errors should never pass silently.\n
 Unless explicitly silenced.\n
 In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\n
 There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\n
 Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\n
 Now is {bt} never.\n
 Although never is often {bt} *right* now.\n
 If the {im} is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\n
 If the {im} is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\n
 Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!""")
